# Automated MCQ Generator
          
It is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based tool that automatically creates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from 
input textual content such as articles, study material, or educational documents. The aim is to reduce manual effort in educational 
assessment and help educators, students, and e-learning platforms quickly generate intelligent, grammar-correct, and concept-based MCQs.

## Methadology and model

The core methodology behind this project involves a multi-stage pipeline beginning with text preprocessing. Once the user provides content, the system cleans and tokenizes the text, removing noise like stopwords and special characters while preserving meaningful sentence structures. The next step involves extracting important keywords using methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). These keywords are considered potential answers and are used to frame MCQs. The sentence containing the keyword is masked or restructured into a question, forming the question stem. Subsequently, the system generates distractors — plausible but incorrect options — using semantic similarity techniques. These distractors are sourced from lexical databases like WordNet, or by computing vector similarities using language embeddings. Finally, the system compiles each MCQ with one correct option and three distractors, formatting them neatly for display.

# Deployment
Deployment of the Automated MCQ Generator can be done either locally or through a simple web application. For local use, the user needs to clone the GitHub repository, install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt file, and run the program through the command line by providing an input file and number of questions to generate. For users who prefer a graphical interface, a Streamlit-based web application is available. By executing streamlit run StreamlitAPP.py, users can launch a browser-based UI where they can upload text or documents and generate MCQs interactively. This user-friendly interface allows real-time generation and visualization of questions, making it ideal for teachers and content creators. In future versions, this application can be easily deployed online using services like Heroku, Vercel, or Docker-based cloud containers to make it publicly accessible.

# Summary
In summary, the Automated MCQ Generator is a highly practical and efficient tool that applies advanced NLP methodologies to solve a real-world educational problem. It intelligently processes textual content, identifies key information, and constructs assessment material in the form of MCQs. The project integrates Python-based NLP libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and WordNet, and optionally supports transformer models for more refined results. Whether used for academic testing, competitive exam preparation, or e-learning platforms, this tool enables rapid and consistent question generation. With a scalable architecture, customizable logic, and optional web interface, it stands as a robust foundation for automated assessment systems in the modern education ecosystem.
